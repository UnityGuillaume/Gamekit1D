# Gamekit 1D

After the [Gamekit2D](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-game-kit)
and the [Gamekit3D](https://forum.unity.com/threads/3d-game-kit-beta-feedback.525246/) :

Introducing the Gamekit1D, a game kit to do a 1D game in Unity. Play as Ellen
fighting Chompers on an alien planet, breaking boxes and avoiding acid pools.

_Ok this is obviously a joke made in one day, this is not a real kit, but I may
come back to it at some point to add door & pressure pad._
